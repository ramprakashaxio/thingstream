/**
 * Create an instance of a delay transport for the modem transport.
 *
 * Some modems (e.g. Simcom, Quectel and u-blox) have a low power mode where
 * the UART clocks are reduced. When in this mode the modem wakes up when the
 * first byte is sent by the MCU, but the character is discarded (it will have
 * framing errors since the clocks are not correct). The MCU should send
 * something (e.g. "\n") and then wait to allow the modem to wakeup before
 * sending the real command to the modem.
 *
 * This transport sends the wakeupString and delays when needed by simulating
 * the sleep and wakeup.
 *
 * @param inner the inner #ThingstreamTransport instance to use
 * @param sleepMs the number of milliseconds before sleep mode activated.
 * @param wakeupString the string to send to the modem to wakeup (e.g. "\n")
 * @param afterWakeMs the number of milliseconds to wait after wakeupString.
 * @return the #ThingstreamTransport instance
